    The items in this checklist represent good practices for creating and communicating a robust design. Try to address&#xD;
    every item to the greatest extent possible to create the best design. It may not be possible to address every item, and&#xD;
    some items may only be able to be addressed to a limited extent. In these cases, be sure that there are good reasons&#xD;
    for only partially addressing an item, or not addressing an item at all.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Design can be performed every day. Use this checklist regularly to assure the design is robust, consistent, and&#xD;
    understandable. Make the design good enough for the specific goals being addressed by using this checklist to identify&#xD;
    areas that have been skipped, ignored, or not sufficiently addressed.&#xD;

    <sectionDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    Do separate design elements have low coupling? Does each design element have high internal cohesion?&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Does the design reflect the architectural objectives of the system?&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Can the system be implemented from the information in the design? Has sufficient detail been included?&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Is the design consistent? Does any part of the design contradict another part of it in such a way that puts the project&#xD;
    at risk?&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Is the design able to accommodate future changes?&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Is the design appropriate to the experience level of other team members and stakeholders, neither too simple nor too&#xD;
    advanced?&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Is the design written in such a way, and is it structured well enough, so it can be maintained easily?&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Does the design constrain the implementation only as much as is necessary?&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Does the design describe all the behavior of the system for the requirements that are currently being addressed?&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Can all parts of the design be traced back to the requirements? Can the requirements (for the current iteration) be&#xD;
    traced to design elements?&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Is there an unambiguous place or places&amp;nbsp;in the design where each behavior exists?&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Are the use case flows that are currently being addressed described in the design?&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Are&amp;nbsp;complex flows outside the Basic Flow&amp;nbsp;addressed, including exceptional cases?&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Has the behavior described in the requirements that are currently being addressed&amp;nbsp;been distributed to the correct&#xD;
    design elements?&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Does the design provide enough information for test design? For example, are the collaborations between design elements&#xD;
    clear enough to create integration tests?&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Have redundant areas of the design been removed so the Implementation does not contain redundant code?&#xD;

    <sectionDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    Does the design describe the system at the appropriate level of abstraction, given the objectives? This usually means&#xD;
    the system is described at a number of different levels of&amp;nbsp;abstraction and perspectives.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Does the design use common vocabulary and terms from the business and technical domains?&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Does the design describe the behavior of the elements unambiguously to the extent that developer tests can be created&#xD;
    toverify the implementation?&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Are the design's constructs, vocabulary, and semantics appropriate to the problem being solved? This usually means the&#xD;
    customer's vocabulary is used, and elements of the design are referenced in a consistent manner.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Is the design organized in a way that team members can easily find the information they're looking for?&#xD;
&lt;/p>Is the notation used to&amp;nbsp;describe the design&amp;nbsp;used consistently?&lt;br />&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Is the design organized in a way that helps team members modify it without contending for the same part of the design?&#xD;
    That is, can mulitple people work on the design in parallel?&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Are the names of elements within the design consistent and easy to interpret?&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Does each design element represent a clearly defined abstraction?&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Is the design as simple as it can be while fulfilling the objectives of the design and giving sufficient direction to&#xD;
    implementers?&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Is the design clear enough and contain enough detail so it can be implemented?&#xD;

    Is the architecture clearly called out in the design ? Can team members and stakeholders clearly identify the portion&#xD;
    of the design that is the architecture?&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Are architectural mechanisms (patterns) clearly defined in the design so they're reusable and understandable?&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Are architectural mechanisms used appropriately? Are they applied in all applicable circumstances?&#xD;

    Do all elements within a subsystem have private visibility? In other words, is the subsystem interface the&amp;nbsp;only&#xD;
    way to access the behavior of elements inside the subsystem?&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Is the interface for each subsystem clearly defined in the design?&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Are the subsystem dependencies documented?&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
