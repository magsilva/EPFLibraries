  <mainDescription>&lt;p>A&#xD;
test case specifies the conditions that must be validated to enable an assessment&#xD;
of aspects of the system under test.  A test case is more formal than a test&#xD;
idea; typically, a test case takes the form of a specification. In less formal&#xD;
environments, you can create test cases by identifying a unique ID, name,&#xD;
associated test data, and expected results.  &lt;/p> &lt;p> Test cases can be derived&#xD;
from many sources, and typically include a subset of the requirements (such&#xD;
as use cases, performance characteristics, and reliability concerns) and other&#xD;
types of quality attributes. For more  information on types of tests and their&#xD;
relationships to quality test attributes, see &lt;a class=&quot;elementLinkWithType&quot;&#xD;

  <purpose>&lt;p&#xD;
>     Use this artifact for the following purposes: &lt;/p> &lt;ul>&#xD;
&lt;li>         To provide a way to capture test inputs, conditions, and expected&#xD;
results for a system     &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;li>         To systematically identify aspects of the software to test  &#xD;
  &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;li>         To specify whether an expected result has been reached, based&#xD;
on the verification of a system requirement, set of         requirements,&#xD;
or scenario     &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul></purpose>
  <impactOfNotHaving>&lt;p> &#xD;
  Without this artifact, it is difficult to validate system functionality.&#xD;
Because this artifact specifies the conditions of acceptance between the stakeholders&#xD;
and the developers, without the artifact, it is difficult to establish exit&#xD;
criteria and to demonstrate that the exit criteria have been met. If the original&#xD;
test cases have not been documented, it is impossible to do regression testing. &lt;/p></impactOfNotHaving>
  <reasonsForNotNeeding>&lt;p&#xD;
> It might not be necessary to create this artifact to maintain or make small&#xD;
enhancements to existing systems, which likely have existing test assets that&#xD;
you can use. You also might not need this artifact if you use a package application&#xD;
that has its own set of test cases. &lt;/p></reasonsForNotNeeding>
