  <purpose>&lt;p>This&#xD;
artifact presents an overview of the intended behavior of the system. It is&#xD;
the basis for agreement between stakeholders and the project team in regards&#xD;
to the intended functionality of the system. It also guides various tasks&#xD;
in the software development lifecycle. &lt;/p></purpose>
  <impactOfNotHaving>Without&#xD;
this artifact, it is difficult to determine all of the relationships between&#xD;
actors and use cases. It is also difficult to gain an understanding of how&#xD;
different use cases relate.</impactOfNotHaving>
  <reasonsForNotNeeding>&lt;p&#xD;
> You might not need this requirement if the overall set of use cases is small&#xD;
and has no complex relationships.   &lt;/p> &lt;p> You also might not need a use-case&#xD;
model if you use an alternative approach to document functional requirements. &lt;/p></reasonsForNotNeeding>
  <representationOptions>&lt;p&#xD;
>Representation options include reports and diagrams from UML modeling tools,&#xD;
graphical representations created by using drawing tools, and drawings on&#xD;
whiteboards. Most of the information in the use-case model is&#xD;
captured in the use-case     specifications. &lt;/p></representationOptions>
