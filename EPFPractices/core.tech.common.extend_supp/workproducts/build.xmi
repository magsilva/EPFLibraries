  <mainDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    This working version of the system is the result of putting the implementation of the system through a build process&#xD;
    (typically an automated build script) that creates an executable version of the system, or one that runs. This&#xD;
    executable version of the system will typically have a number of supporting files that are also considered part of this&#xD;
    composite artifact.&#xD;
&lt;/p></mainDescription>
  <purpose>Deliver incremental value to the user and customer, and provide a testable artifact &#xD;
for verification.</purpose>
  <impactOfNotHaving>&lt;p> Without this artifact, there is no operational version of the system. &lt;/p></impactOfNotHaving>
  <reasonsForNotNeeding>&lt;p>&#xD;
    This artifact is not needed if the development of an application is not within the scope of the solution.&#xD;
&lt;/p></reasonsForNotNeeding>
  <representationOptions>&lt;p> This work product is&amp;nbsp;almost always a composite product made up of numerous &#xD;
  parts required to make the executable system. Therefore, a build is more than &#xD;
  just executable files; it also includes such things as configuration files, &#xD;
  Help files, and data repositories that will be put together, resulting in the &#xD;
  product that the users will run. The specifics of those parts will vary by technology &#xD;
  in use. &lt;/p></representationOptions>
