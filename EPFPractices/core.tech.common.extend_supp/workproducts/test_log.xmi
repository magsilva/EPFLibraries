  <mainDescription>This&#xD;
artifact provides a detailed, typically time-based record that both verifies&#xD;
that a set of tests were run, and provides information that relates to the&#xD;
success of those tests.  The focus is typically on providing an accurate audit&#xD;
trail, which enables you to undertake a post-run diagnosis of failures. This&#xD;
raw data is subsequently analyzed to determine the results of an aspect of&#xD;
the test effort.</mainDescription>
  <purpose>&lt;ul>&#xD;
&lt;li>         To provide verification that a set of tests was run     &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;li>         To provide information that relates to the success of those tests&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul></purpose>
  <impactOfNotHaving>&lt;p> &#xD;
   Without this or similar documentation, there is no record of which tests&#xD;
were run, what variances were discovered, and what action was taken. If this&#xD;
information is not available: &lt;/p> &lt;ul>&#xD;
&lt;li>         There is no way to know which tests passed and which failed &#xD;
   &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;li>         There is no way to assess the status of testing and the quality&#xD;
of the product at that level of testing     &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;li>         It is difficult to know how many tests remain outstanding   &#xD;
 &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;li>         Contractual and legal issues might arise     &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul></impactOfNotHaving>
  <reasonsForNotNeeding>&lt;p&#xD;
> When you execute automated tests, test logs are automatically produced.&#xD;
Typically, the issue is not whether to produce the     test log, but whether&#xD;
to keep a record, and where to keep the records. For manual testing, the issue&#xD;
is whether to keep a separate test log or to summarize the test results in&#xD;
another form.  &lt;/p></reasonsForNotNeeding>
  <representationOptions>&lt;p&#xD;
> Because this is a collection of raw data for subsequent analysis, it can&#xD;
be represented in a number of ways: &lt;/p> &lt;ul>&#xD;
&lt;li>         For manual tests, log the actual results on a copy&#xD;
of the manual Test Script     &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;li>         For automated tests, direct the output to log files that you&#xD;
can trace back to the automated Test Script     &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;li>         Track raw results data in a test management tool     &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul></representationOptions>
