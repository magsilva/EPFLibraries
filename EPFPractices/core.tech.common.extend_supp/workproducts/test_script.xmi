  <purpose>&lt;p> &#xD;
   Test scripts implement a subset of required tests in an efficient and effective&#xD;
manner. &lt;/p></purpose>
  <impactOfNotHaving>Without&#xD;
this artifact, it is difficult to ensure that tests are run consistently so&#xD;
that results are repeatable and errors can be recreated. If you do not use&#xD;
a test script, it is more difficult to verify that errors were not caused&#xD;
because of the way tests were run.</impactOfNotHaving>
  <reasonsForNotNeeding>&lt;p&#xD;
>This artifact might not be required if the tests are simple or if testing&#xD;
is done on an informal basis. However, for this approach to be successful,&#xD;
testers must track their processes, as they might need to recreate a problem&#xD;
scenario. Alternatively, you can use automatic capture and playback tools&#xD;
to provide a record of testing. &lt;/p></reasonsForNotNeeding>
