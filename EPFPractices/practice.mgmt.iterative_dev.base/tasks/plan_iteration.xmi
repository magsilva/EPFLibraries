  <mainDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    During project planning, iterations are identified, but the estimates have an acceptable uncertainty due to the lack of&#xD;
    detail at the project inception. This task is repeated for each iteration within a release. It allows the team to&#xD;
    increase the accuracy of the estimates for one iteration, as more detail is known along the project. The project&#xD;
    manager has the responsibility of ensuring that the team commits to a reasonable amount of work for the&#xD;
    iteration, based on team performance from previous iterations.&#xD;

    <sectionDescription>The work items list should be prioritized before you plan the next iteration. Consider what has changed since the last&#xD;

    <sectionDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    Work with the team to refine the iteration objectives found in the project definition and scope, and document them in&#xD;
    the iteration plan in order to provide high-level direction to what should be targeted for the iteration. The&#xD;
    objectives should be driven based on stakeholder priorities, and will be revised as the iteration plan is finalized.&#xD;
    Those objectives are usually defined as high-level capabilities or scenarios, which need to be implemented and tested&#xD;
    during the iteration in order to deliver increased value to the customer.&lt;br />&#xD;

    <sectionDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    Throughout the project, new assumptions and concerns may arise. The team identifies and prioritizes new risks as part&#xD;
    of iteration planning, updating the risk list. Responses to risks are added to the work items list, influencing the&#xD;
    work that is being planned for that iteration.&#xD;

    <sectionDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    The project manager works with the team, and especially the project stakeholders, to identify the high-priority work&#xD;
    items from the work items list to be addressed. The high-level objectives provide guidance on what work items should be&#xD;
    considered. The iteration plan from previous iteration should include an assessment of the results, and can also be&#xD;
    used as input to the current iteration planning. The team reviews its velocity and determines the amount of work that&#xD;
    can be done within the iteration. The team breaks down into tasks those work items that are assigned to the iteration,&#xD;
    and estimates the effort to complete each task. Typical tasks range from half a day to two days in length, and are&#xD;
    captured in the work items list. See &lt;a class=&quot;elementLinkWithType&quot;&#xD;

&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    When the team has decided to take on a work item, it will assign the work to one or several team members. Ideally, this&#xD;
    is done by team members signing up to do the work, since this makes people motivated and committed to doing the job.&#xD;
    However, based on your culture, you may instead have the project manager assign the work.&lt;br />&#xD;

    <sectionDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    Each iteration should include testing as a part of the evaluation, as well as the test objectives and test cases&#xD;
    that need to be detailed. Other evaluation criteria may include successful demonstrations to key stakeholders, or&#xD;
    favorable usage by a small group of target users. Document evaluation criteria in the iteration plan.&#xD;

    <sectionDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    Depending on the results of the previous iteration assessment, update the project definition work products as&#xD;
    needed. Necessary changes can encompass the need to acquire new resources, to absorb an unplanned effort increase, or&#xD;
    to implement a specific change request. If a change affects defined project milestones, consult with the&#xD;
    stakeholders before committing to it.&#xD;
