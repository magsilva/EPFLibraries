    Developing the team is part of executing the project. The project manager is responsible for improving the interactions and trust &#xD;
    between team members, incorporating team building into project activities, and empowering the&#xD;
    team to make decisions. Management is done by objectives and not by time reporting.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The project manager helps the team meet the iteration objectives by removing constraints, and by monitoring the progress&#xD;
    and work remaining to completion. When the team is falling behind, the project manager helps the team&#xD;
    assess how it can reduce work and still meet the iteration goals. Involve stakeholders in approving changes and actions&#xD;
    that affect them, so that their objectives for the iteration can be met, and the issues they raise can be solved throughout&#xD;
    the iteration.&#xD;
&lt;/p></mainDescription>

    <sectionDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    Continuously monitor the iteration to ensure that it is progressing appropriately. Track the progress of the current&#xD;
    iteration by maintaining visibility on the status of the items that are being worked on during the iteration. In&#xD;
    particular, it is important to be able to understand how quickly the team is moving through the work scheduled for the&#xD;
    iteration, and how accurate the estimates were &lt;a class=&quot;elementlinkwithusertext&quot; href=&quot;./../../core.mgmt.common.base/guidances/supportingmaterials/references.mgmt_D80619F3.html#LEF07&quot; guid=&quot;_JlTPUM6aEdyuBO4ZIzcyig&quot;>[LEF07]&lt;/a>.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Share information about the progress being made by having quick, frequent meetings with the entire project team. These&#xD;
    meetings are useful to understand what team members have accomplished since the last meeting, and what they plan to&#xD;
    accomplish before the next meeting. It also allows the team to identify any blocking issues. See &lt;a class=&quot;elementLink&quot; href=&quot;./../../core.mgmt.slot.base/guidances/guidelines/collaboration_guidance_slot_D3B8DD40.html&quot; guid=&quot;_68JUYN8-Edyhmsbt0Xyl8A&quot;>[Collaboration Guidance]&lt;/a> for more information.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Track the status of each work item by using visual indicators of state information (for example: defined, completed,&#xD;
    accepted) in a wall or automated tool. Since iterations are typically fixed in duration, another primary way to&#xD;
    gauge progress is to continuously monitor current status and also estimate how much work remains. Plot an&#xD;
    iteration burndown chart on a daily basis in order to visualize progress on a given iteration. This chart is plotted&#xD;
    with the total estimates for all the items that are not yet started and the estimated remaining effort for any item in&#xD;
    progress. See &lt;a class=&quot;elementLinkWithType&quot; href=&quot;./../../practice.mgmt.iterative_dev.base/guidances/reports/iteration_burndown_9C1C96F5.html&quot; guid=&quot;_uAzgkDg3Edu4E8ZdmlYjtA&quot;>Report: Iteration Burndown&lt;/a> for more information.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Take corrective actions to adjust the course of the iteration if the burndown chart shows that the work will not be&#xD;
    finished as planned.&#xD;
&lt;/p></sectionDescription>

    <sectionDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    Because outside stakeholders do not participate in the daily activities of the team, it is important that the status of&#xD;
    the project should be communicated to them as often as possible. This communication significantly lowers&#xD;
    the risk of disconnect between the development team and the stakeholders. The status provides the team with&#xD;
    data they can use to improve their development process.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Besides the iteration status, the overall project status can be captured and communicated in&#xD;
    a burndown report for the whole project. This report should show the progress toward the release&#xD;
    date, and should be updated at the end of every iteration (when metrics, such as the team's velocity, can also be&#xD;
    provided). This allows the team to predict what it can accomplish on the remaining project iterations. Other&#xD;
    metrics (such as number of test cases passed) can also be used to present iteration and project status.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Keep the status information visible to stakeholders and the project team at all times in a project workspace (walls or&#xD;
    automated tool), where stakeholders can come and experience first-hand the progress being made by the team.&#xD;

    <sectionDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    One of the project manager's key responsibilities is to know about the project team's problems and issues. The manager&#xD;
    needs to focus on problems that are blocking progress. A quick, daily meeting is usually a good way to monitor those&#xD;
    problems and issues. A record of issues that have to be solved within the team may be kept in the &lt;a class=&quot;elementLink&quot; href=&quot;./../../practice.mgmt.iterative_dev.base/workproducts/iteration_plan_B46FED39.html&quot; guid=&quot;_0aQBEslgEdmt3adZL5Dmdw&quot;>Iteration Plan&lt;/a>&lt;font color=&quot;#003399&quot;>.&lt;/font> If a critical problem or&#xD;
    issue is likely to take a lot of time to solve, capture it in the Work Items List so that it can be assigned to an&#xD;
    individual.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Identify the cause and impact of problems and exceptions as they arise. Identify possible solutions for problems that&#xD;
    have an immediate impact on the short-term goals and objectives. Identify who needs to be involved in implementing&#xD;
    the solution. Define the corrective actions and implement them.&#xD;

    <sectionDescription>When a team is falling significantly behind, or critical problems occur that prevent the team from meeting the&#xD;
iteration objectives, it may be necessary to descope work to ensure that the team delivers a useful product increment by&#xD;
the end of the iteration, while maximizing stakeholder value. The project manager should work with the team and&#xD;
stakeholders to revise the &lt;a class=&quot;elementLink&quot; href=&quot;./../../practice.mgmt.iterative_dev.base/workproducts/iteration_plan_B46FED39.html&quot; guid=&quot;_0aQBEslgEdmt3adZL5Dmdw&quot;>Iteration Plan&lt;/a> and, as necessary, reduce the emphasis on less critical tasks by postponing&#xD;
them to a subsequent iteration. In rare cases, if the iteration objectives still seem impossible to meet, the team might&#xD;
consider terminating the iteration or reformulating the iteration to a new objective.</sectionDescription>

  <keyConsiderations>&lt;p>&#xD;
    Select an approach for the collection of basic metrics: ideally, they are automatically generated from the tools at&#xD;
