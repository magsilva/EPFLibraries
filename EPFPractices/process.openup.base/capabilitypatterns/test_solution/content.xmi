  <mainDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    This activity is repeated throughout the project lifecycle. The main goal of this activity is to validate that the&#xD;
    current build of the system satisfies the requirements allocated to it.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Throughout the iterations, your intent is to validate that the implemented requirements reflect a robust architecture,&#xD;
    and that the remaining requirements are consistently implemented on top of that architecture. As developers implement&#xD;
    the solution for the requirements in a given iteration, unit test the integrated source code. Then, a&#xD;
    tester&amp;nbsp;conducts system-level testing in parallel with development to make sure that the solution, which is&#xD;
    continuously being integrated, satisfies the intent specified in the test cases. The tester defines what techniques to&#xD;
    use, what the data input is, and what test suites to create. As tests run, defects are identified and added to the work&#xD;
    items list, so that they can be prioritized as part of the work that you will do during iterations.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Stakeholders and end-users also may also be involved in performing tests to accept the release.&#xD;

  <usageNotes>&lt;p>&#xD;
    Testing must occur throughout the process and throughout each iteration. Testing is not a final inspection to be&#xD;
    performed at the end of the project. As requirements are implemented and integrated into a build, you should test them&#xD;
    as soon as possible.&#xD;
&lt;/p></usageNotes>
