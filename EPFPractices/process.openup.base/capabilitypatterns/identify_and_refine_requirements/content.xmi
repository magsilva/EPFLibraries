  <mainDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    This activity describes the tasks you perform to gather, specify, analyze, and validate a subset of system's&#xD;
    requirements prior to implementation and verification. This does not imply that all requirements are detailed prior to&#xD;
    commencing implementation. Rather, you perform this activity throughout the lifecycle with stakeholders and the entire&#xD;
    development team collaborating to ensure that a clear, consistent, correct, verifiable, and feasible set of&#xD;
    requirements is available, as needed, to drive implementation and verification.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    During &lt;b>Inception&lt;/b>, the focus is on gaining agreement on the problem to be solved, gathering stakeholder needs,&#xD;
    and capturing high-level system features.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    During &lt;b>Elaboration&lt;/b>, the focus shifts to defining the solution. This consists of finding those requirements that&#xD;
    have the most value to stakeholders, that are particularly challenging or risky, or that are architecturally&#xD;
    significant. You then describe requirements (that are prioritized, via the work items list, for implementation in the&#xD;
    early iterations) in sufficient detail to validate the development team's understanding of the requirements, to ensure&#xD;
    concurrence with stakeholders, and to permit software development to begin. For each of these requirements, define&#xD;
    associated test cases to ensure that the requirements are verifiable, and to provide the guidance needed for&#xD;
    verification and validation.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    During Construction, the focus shifts to refining the system definition. This consists of detailing the remaining&#xD;
    requirements and associated test cases as necessary to drive implementation and verification, and managing requirements&#xD;
    change.&#xD;
