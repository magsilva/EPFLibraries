    The purpose of this phase is to establish the baseline of the architecture of the system and provide a stable basis for&#xD;
    the bulk of the&amp;nbsp;development effort in the next phase.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    There are objectives for the Elaboration phase that help you address risks associated with requirements, architecture,&#xD;
    costs, and schedule &lt;a class=&quot;elementlinkwithusertext&quot; href=&quot;./../../../core.mgmt.common.base/guidances/supportingmaterials/references.mgmt_D80619F3.html#KRO03&quot; guid=&quot;_JlTPUM6aEdyuBO4ZIzcyig&quot;>[KRO03]&lt;/a>:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &#xD;
    &lt;p> &lt;strong>Get a more detailed understanding of the requirements.&lt;/strong> &#xD;
      Having a good understanding of the majority of requirements enables you &#xD;
      to create a more detailed plan and to get buy-in from stakeholders. Be sure &#xD;
      to gain an in-depth understanding of the most critical requirements to be &#xD;
      validated by&amp;nbsp;the architecture. &lt;/p>&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &#xD;
    &lt;p> &lt;strong>Design, implement, validate, and establish the baseline for the &#xD;
      architecture.&lt;/strong> Design, implement, and test a skeleton structure &#xD;
      of the system. Although the functionality is not complete yet, most of the &#xD;
      interfaces between the building blocks are implemented and tested. This &#xD;
      is referred to&lt;i> an&lt;/i>&lt;strong> &lt;/strong>&lt;i>executable architecture&lt;/i>. &#xD;
    &lt;/p>&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;p>&#xD;
            &lt;strong>Mitigate essential risks, and produce accurate schedule and cost estimates.&lt;/strong> Many technical&#xD;
            risks are addressed as a result of detailing the requirements and of designing, implementing, and testing the&#xD;
            architecture. Refine and detail the high-level project plan.&#xD;
        &lt;/p>&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;h4>&#xD;
    Key considerations&#xD;
&lt;/h4>&#xD;
&lt;p> The number of iterations in the Elaboration phase is dependent on, but not &#xD;
  limited to, factors such as green-field development compared to maintenance &#xD;
  cycle, unprecedented system compared to well-known technology and architecture, &#xD;
  and so on. &lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p> Typically, on the first iteration, it is better to design, implement, and &#xD;
  test a small number of critical scenarios to identify what type of architecture &#xD;
  and architectural mechanisms you need, so you can mitigate the most crucial &#xD;
  risks. You also detail high-risk requirements that have to be addressed early &#xD;
  in the project. You test enough to validate that the architectural risks are &#xD;
  mitigated. &lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p> During the subsequent iterations, you fix whatever was not right from the &#xD;
  previous iteration. You design, implement, and test the remaining architecturally &#xD;
  significant scenarios, ensuring that you check all major areas of the system &#xD;
  (architectural coverage), so that potential risks are identified as early as &#xD;
  possible. &lt;a class=&quot;elementlinkwithusertext&quot; href=&quot;./../../../core.tech.common.base/guidances/supportingmaterials/references.tech_6CCF393.html&quot; guid=&quot;_9ToeIB83Edqsvps02rpOOg&quot;>[KRO03]&lt;/a> &#xD;
