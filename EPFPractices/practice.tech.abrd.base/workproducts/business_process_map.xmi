&lt;p>&#xD;
    A Business Process is a collection of interrelated tasks, which solve a particular business problem or process a&#xD;
    business event: a claim is received and needs to be processed within 15 days.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    A business process can be decomposed into several sub-processes, which have their own attributes, but also contribute&#xD;
    to achieving the goal of the super-process.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The following process map is done using BPMN 1.0 and illustrates a loan underwriting process. The entry point is a mail&#xD;
    with the loan application received, then the process follow a set of activities to decide if the loan is elligible and&#xD;
    what kind of loan product we can offer to the borrower and at what financial condition. This process as decribed here&#xD;
    is not taking into account the actors of the process. Swim lanes can be added&amp;nbsp;to group tasks per actors.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
