    SBVR is a standard of the Object Management Group intended to formalize complex business rules, and business&#xD;
    vocabularies. SBVR is part of the OMGâ€™s Model Driven Architecture (MDA). The goal of SBVR&amp;nbsp;is to&amp;nbsp;capture&#xD;
    specifications in natural language and represent them in formal logic so they can be machine-processed.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    &lt;a   href=&quot;http://www.omg.org/docs/formal/08-01-02.pdf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;  >SBVR&lt;/a> includes two specialized vocabularies:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;p>&#xD;
            Vocabulary for Describing &lt;em>Business Vocabularies&lt;/em> which deals with all kinds of terms and meanings.&#xD;
        &lt;/p>&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;p>&#xD;
            Vocabulary for Describing &lt;em>Business Rules&lt;/em> which deals with the specification of the meaning of business&#xD;
            rules, and builds on top of the previous vocabulary.&#xD;
        &lt;/p>&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The meanings are declined into concept, question&amp;nbsp;and proposition. The meaning is what someone intends to express&#xD;
    or understands. A phrase such as &quot;&lt;em>We deny the invoice if the medical treatment was done after one year of the&#xD;
    accident&quot;&lt;/em> has a&amp;nbsp;clear meaning for a claim processor within a car insurance company. As analyst we need to&#xD;
    transform logically this meaning into concepts which has a unique interpretation so that we can represent the business&#xD;
    knowledge within a comprehensive vocabulary.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Concept includes a unique combination of characteristics or properties.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Business rules are declined into two possible classes:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        structural &amp;nbsp;(definitional) business rule which are&amp;nbsp;about how the business chooses to organize the things&#xD;
        it deals with, they are considered as necessity. In this context the statements describing the rule can describe&#xD;
        the necessity, the impossibility or the restricted possibility.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        operative (behavior)&amp;nbsp;business rule govern the conduct of business activity. They&amp;nbsp;are considered as&#xD;
        obligation and directly enforceable. When considering operative business rule it is important to look at the level&#xD;
        of enforcement to specify the severity of action imposed by the rule in order to put or keep it in force.&#xD;
        Statements to describe the rule include obligation, prohibition, and restricted permission.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    In SBVR, rules are always constructed by applying necessity or obligation to fact types . Fact type is an association&#xD;
    between two or more concepts.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Using SBVR the team can document the semantic of the business entities, facts and business rules. The persistence&#xD;
    mechanism uses XMI to facilitate interchange between group and tools. SBVR allows multilingual development, since it is&#xD;
    based on separation between symbols and their meaning. SBVR proposes Structured English as one of possibly many&#xD;
    notations that can map to the SBVR Metamodel.&lt;br />&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    SBVR is a good fit&amp;nbsp;for describing business domains and requirements for business processes and&amp;nbsp;business rule&#xD;
    applications.&#xD;
