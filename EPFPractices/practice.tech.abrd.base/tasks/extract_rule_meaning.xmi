     face=&quot;Arial&quot;>During the elicitation activity the raw description of the rule uses business terms as used in common&#xD;
    language used by the people. This presents what the business users think about the way things are done in the company.&#xD;
    They are linking words with statements with all the different semantic attached to them. The first activity focuses on&#xD;
    analyzing this rule description&amp;nbsp;to extract&amp;nbsp;the business entities and terms used in a formal non ambiguous&#xD;
    fashion.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/font>&lt;/span>&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    We are discussing about Business Term here, as reference to a business concept used in daily business operations.They&#xD;
    are often found in different departments or refer to the same business concept from a different perspective: they are&#xD;
    synonyms. A term may describe business concept which will be mapped to a Class, a characteristic of a business entity&#xD;
    which will be mapped to attribute of a class, and sometime a term may describe the way a business object behave, in&#xD;
    that last case it will be mapped within method of a final state machine.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The second concept presented in the analysis of rule is the Fact. Fact is a combination of terms that describes what&#xD;
    business people know about their business. It connects terms into sensible business relevant observations.&lt;br&#xD;

    As stated by the SBVR specification meaning is built of concepts, questions and propositions. the concepts will build&#xD;
    our underlying data model used by the executable rules, and the proposition will structure the data model and can also&#xD;
    be mapped to rules.&lt;br />&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;

    All these informations&amp;nbsp;help to build a&amp;nbsp;first logical data model used to build the underlying object&#xD;
    model&amp;nbsp;used by the rules. We can use UML tool to design a class diagrma, generates java code and import such code&#xD;
    in the rule IDE.&lt;br />&#xD;
