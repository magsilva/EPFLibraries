  <mainDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    The architect has to address as soon as possible in the project life cycle:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Integrate the Rule Engine into the business application using a service oriented design to facilitate reuse and&#xD;
        scalability. If an embedded solution is the choice for accessing the BRE the design should address the engine&#xD;
        integration at the API level.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Deploy Business Rules Management System into the business and IT organizations. This includes the deployment of the&#xD;
        Rule Developer IDE and Rule Analyst web based component into the IT architecture. It also addresses the change&#xD;
        management processes to design on top of the tools.&lt;br />&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    For a BRMS deployment architect needs to integrate the following components within the IT architecture:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        The Rule Engine as an executable class, callable using proprietary API or the JSR94 API. Rule Engine can be an&#xD;
        embedded component or deployed within a pool as reusable components. Java Connector Architecture can be a solution&#xD;
        to manage a pool of Rule Engines. JCA implementation offers a set of services which any deployed adapters can&#xD;
        leverage: such as security and transaction propagation.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br />&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        The Rule Set(s): As script file, it needs to be managed and deployed dynamically and can follow a specific life&#xD;
        cycle. It can be also packaged as a jar and available after the system startup, or hot deployed using JMX.&lt;br />&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        The IDE, like a Rule Studio, used by the developers to implement the rules, the rule set structure and the&#xD;
        technical elements of the rule sets.&lt;br />&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        A Web based Rule management platform to let business users and analysts being able to maintain the rules.&lt;br />&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        A Rule testing framework to support functional testing of the rule set and non-regression tests.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
