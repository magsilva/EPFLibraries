  <mainDescription>&lt;h3> Getting started&amp;nbsp; &lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    There are several steps to get started with the Whole Team practice.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&lt;b>Understand the underlying philosophies behind this practice.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/b>&lt;br />&#xD;
  These philosophies are captured in the&amp;nbsp;&lt;a class=&quot;elementLink&quot; href=&quot;./../../../practice.mgmt.whole_team.base/guidances/guidelines/self_organize_work_assignments_F47FC314.html&quot; guid=&quot;_rmBEkJjsEduad8I_c-ogIA&quot;>Self-Organize Work Assignments&lt;/a>,&amp;nbsp;&lt;a class=&quot;elementLink&quot; href=&quot;./../../../practice.mgmt.whole_team.base/guidances/guidelines/maintain_a_sustainable_pace_A132240B.html&quot; guid=&quot;_KzYHYMLmEdysDsQChI42QQ&quot;>Maintain a Sustainable Pace&lt;/a>, and&amp;nbsp;&lt;a class=&quot;elementLink&quot; href=&quot;./../../../practice.mgmt.whole_team.base/guidances/guidelines/daily_meetings_3690A7AD.html&quot; guid=&quot;_251UMCmREdyy6Oss2-0s1g&quot;>Daily Meetings&lt;/a>&amp;nbsp;guidelines.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&lt;b> Discuss the implications of this practice with management.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/b>&lt;br />&#xD;
  The Whole Team practice often requires changes to the way that projects are &#xD;
  managed and&amp;nbsp;governed, because &quot;whole teams&quot; are&amp;nbsp;often more self-contained &#xD;
  than traditional project teams.&amp;nbsp;For example, with self-organization, detailed &#xD;
  planning is typically&amp;nbsp;performed at the beginning of each iteration in a &#xD;
  just-in-time manner and not at the beginning of the project.&amp;nbsp;The implication &#xD;
  is that management will receive different and often better-quality artifacts &#xD;
  at different points in time than from project teams that do not adopt this practice. &#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&lt;b>Discuss this practice with your team.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/b>&lt;br />&#xD;
  The concept of maintaining a sustainable pace is often attractive to&amp;nbsp;team &#xD;
  members.&amp;nbsp;But are they&amp;nbsp;comfortable with self-organization?&amp;nbsp;Are &#xD;
  they comfortable with sharing their current status in daily meetings?&amp;nbsp;Do &#xD;
  they appreciate how a Whole Team approach can improve their overall productivity? &#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&lt;b> Identify viable aspects of this practice for your situation.&lt;/b> &lt;br />&#xD;
  Your team may not be able to adopt all aspects of this practice.&amp;nbsp;For example, &#xD;
  if your project is a high-priority, &quot;emergency&quot; project, perhaps you will not &#xD;
  be able to adopt a sustainable pace in the short term. &lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&lt;b> Prioritize your adoption efforts. &lt;/b>&lt;br />&#xD;
  Some project teams can adopt this practice all at once, while&amp;nbsp;other teams &#xD;
  find that they need to ease into self-organization or into daily meetings.&amp;nbsp;Adopt &#xD;
  the aspects that are easy for your team right away, and then adopt the other &#xD;
  aspects one or two at a time, as appropriate, over a period of several weeks. &#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h3> Common pitfalls &lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    There are several common pitfalls that project teams run into when adopting this practice.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p> &lt;b>Traditional project management culture &lt;br />&#xD;
  &lt;/b> In many ways, the whole team practice is all about pushing many management &#xD;
  activities into the hands of the people who do the actual work, a philosophy&amp;nbsp;that &#xD;
  goes against the grain in some organizations.&amp;nbsp;For example, your&amp;nbsp;organization &#xD;
  may&amp;nbsp;have a belief system where &quot;managers do the planning; the rest of the &#xD;
  staff does what they are told&quot; or an &quot;estimation should be left to estimators&quot; &#xD;
  mindset. You will need to overcome those kinds of&amp;nbsp;beliefs when adopting &#xD;
  this practice.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p> &lt;b>Insufficient time to change &lt;br />&#xD;
  &lt;/b>It can take weeks, if not months, for experienced professionals to get used &#xD;
  to some of the aspects of this practice, in particular daily meetings and self-organization.&amp;nbsp;You &#xD;
  cannot expect people to change overnight.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p> &lt;strong>Individuals struggle at first to see the &quot;whole team&quot;&lt;/strong> &lt;br />&#xD;
  Many people, in particular specialists, are used to working on their own and &#xD;
  not as part of an overall team.&amp;nbsp;They often struggle to understand why it &#xD;
  is&amp;nbsp;important to do so.&amp;nbsp;For example, you may hear people ask why they &#xD;
  need to participate in&amp;nbsp;a daily meeting when a weekly status report is easier &#xD;
  to write.&amp;nbsp;They do not&amp;nbsp;realize that it is&amp;nbsp;critical for everyone &#xD;
  on the entire team to understand everyone's status, not just for the manager &#xD;
  to know.&amp;nbsp;Although the individual might be proceeding effectively on one &#xD;
  task, they might not realize that several others are being blocked by their &#xD;
  lack of progress on other tasks that they haven't started yet.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/p></mainDescription>
