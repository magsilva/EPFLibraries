  <mainDescription>&lt;p> Whole teams are self-organizing, cross-functional, fluid, and highly collaborative.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&lt;i>Self-organization &lt;/i>means&amp;nbsp;that&amp;nbsp;everyone on the team works together &#xD;
  to determine the best way to perform the&amp;nbsp;work required fulfilling the goals &#xD;
  of the team.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>A &lt;i>whole team &lt;/i>is cross-functional, containing people with the combined &#xD;
  expertise to perform the work.&amp;nbsp;This includes people with modeling skills, &#xD;
  testing skills, management skills, and programming skills. It also includes &#xD;
  stakeholders with the required domain knowledge.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&lt;i>Fluidity&lt;/i> refers to the idea that the team composition will vary over &#xD;
  time.&amp;nbsp;For example, at the beginning of the project, you may need someone &#xD;
  with deep build experience to help organize the team's build strategy, but after &#xD;
  this work is finished, this person leaves the team.&amp;nbsp;Whole teams work in&amp;nbsp;a &#xD;
  highly collaborative manner, adopting the most effective communication techniques &#xD;
  for their situations and striving to work together as closely as possible. It &#xD;
  is through collaboration that people make each other better. &lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The goal of the&amp;nbsp;Whole Team&amp;nbsp;practice is to ensure that:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
  &lt;li> &lt;strong>Everyone has a sense of belonging on the team, of being in it together.&lt;/strong>&amp;nbsp;There &#xD;
    should be no &quot;outsiders,&quot; no &quot;them&quot; but only &quot;us.&amp;quot;&amp;nbsp;When everyone &#xD;
    is on the team,&amp;nbsp;people&amp;nbsp;avoid&amp;nbsp;blaming others. Instead, there &#xD;
    is&amp;nbsp;a sense of&amp;nbsp;collective ownership. &lt;/li>&#xD;
  &lt;li> &lt;strong>The team includes everyone required to build the system.&lt;/strong>&amp;nbsp;Ideally, &#xD;
    you want a self-contained team that has the skills and knowledge to get the &#xD;
    job done.&amp;nbsp;Realistically, this is not&amp;nbsp;always possible at all points, &#xD;
    and sometimes you will need to bring in outside experts for brief periods &#xD;
    of time for specific goals.&amp;nbsp;For example, you might need someone with &#xD;
    experience at setting up the database at the beginning of the project or, &#xD;
    in the middle of the project, someone with specific expertise in a certain &#xD;
    aspect of the domain. &lt;/li>&#xD;
  &lt;li> &lt;strong>Everyone on the team contributes any way that they can.&lt;/strong>&amp;nbsp;With &#xD;
    a whole team approach there is a move&amp;nbsp;away from specialists who focus &#xD;
    on a specific category of work, such as&amp;nbsp;analysis or&amp;nbsp;database administration,&amp;nbsp;towards &#xD;
    generalizing specialists who may have that expertise&amp;nbsp;but will also work &#xD;
    outside of their specialty to help&amp;nbsp;address the current need.&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &#xD;
  &lt;/li>&#xD;
  &lt;li> &lt;strong>The team is self-organizing.&lt;/strong>&amp;nbsp;The people best-suited &#xD;
    to plan and organize the work are the ones who do the work. This results in&amp;nbsp;better &#xD;
    estimates (particularly when people know that they'll be held to those estimates), &#xD;
    more realistic schedules, and increased acceptance of the plan by the team. &#xD;
  &lt;/li>&#xD;
  &lt;li> &lt;strong>&lt;strong>The team maintains a sustainable pace.&lt;/strong>&lt;/strong>&amp;nbsp; &#xD;
    Just as you don't sprint throughout a marathon, you can't go for weeks or &#xD;
    months at a time working unrealistic levels of overtime.&amp;nbsp;Tired people &#xD;
    are not productive people. &lt;/li>&#xD;
  &lt;li> &lt;strong>Everyone works together closely.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong>Not only is it safer, &#xD;
    it is better to ask others for help when you need it.&amp;nbsp;Another&amp;nbsp;strategy &#xD;
    for improving collaboration within the team is to have daily standup (scrum) &#xD;
    meetings where you share your current status and explain any problems that &#xD;
    you might have.&amp;nbsp;Non-solo development practices, such as pair programming &#xD;
    and modeling with others, are also common in the Whole Team approach. &lt;/li>&#xD;

  <problem>&lt;p> The single most important productivity factor is the people on the team and &#xD;
  the way that they interact.&amp;nbsp;The Whole Team practice describes strategies &#xD;
  to increase overall productivity through streamlining the organization structure &#xD;
  of the team and through streamlining collaboration within the team. &lt;/p></problem>
  <application>&lt;p>&#xD;
    These are the three best ways to understand this practice:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ol>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Familiarize yourself with its overall structure -- what it is in it and how it is organized.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Read the main description to understand the thinking behind the practice.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
