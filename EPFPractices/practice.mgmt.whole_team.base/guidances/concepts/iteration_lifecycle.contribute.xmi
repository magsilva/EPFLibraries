  <mainDescription>&lt;p> Team members work more effectively if they can influence what they do and &#xD;
  how they do it, rather than operating in an environment where they are told &#xD;
  what to do. Giving the team the ability and responsibility to organize their &#xD;
  work and determine how to best meet their commitments motivates team members &#xD;
  to do their best. This also helps them collaborate to ensure that the right &#xD;
  skills are applied to the appropriate tasks. Self-organization impacts many &#xD;
  areas, including how planning and commitments are made (by a team, not by individuals), &#xD;
  how work is assigned (you sign up rather than get assigned), and how team members &#xD;
  view their roles in the project (team member first, job function second). &lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p> &lt;a class=&quot;elementLinkWithUserText&quot; href=&quot;./../../../practice.mgmt.whole_team.base/guidances/guidelines/self_organize_work_assignments_F47FC314.html&quot; guid=&quot;_rmBEkJjsEduad8I_c-ogIA&quot;>Self-organization&lt;/a>&amp;nbsp;requires &#xD;
  a few things to work: &lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &#xD;
  &lt;li> Transparency and commitments are crucial to aid in team communication and &#xD;
    to bring out the best in the team members. Open communication about the team's &#xD;
    commitments related to the iteration lifecycle and personal commitments made &#xD;
    relative to micro increments ensures that execution problems are vetted and &#xD;
    the right people are focused on solving them. &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &#xD;
  &lt;li> Coaching is required to help teams self-organize and to remove barriers &#xD;
    for success. The assumption is that the project manager is the coach. This &#xD;
    requires that the project manager avoid a command-and-control style of management &#xD;
    in favor of a coaching style. This has been a key recommendation in management &#xD;
    books for the last two decades, but some project managers may still not be &#xD;
    able to make that transition. &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul></mainDescription>
