&lt;p> Daily meetings are also known as&lt;i> scrum&lt;/i> meetings &lt;a class=&quot;elementLinkWithUserText&quot; href=&quot;./../../../core.mgmt.common.base/guidances/supportingmaterials/references.mgmt_D80619F3.html#SCH04&quot; guid=&quot;_JlTPUM6aEdyuBO4ZIzcyig&quot;>[SCH04]&lt;/a>. &#xD;
  These meetings help check the&amp;nbsp;heartbeat of the project. All team members &#xD;
  are required to attend. The meetings are held in the same place at the same &#xD;
  time every work day and should&amp;nbsp;not last for more than 15 minutes. Usually, &#xD;
  teams conduct the meetings with everyone standing up to keep them short (thus &#xD;
  some call them &amp;quot;standup&amp;quot; meetings). Anyone who is directly involved&amp;nbsp;can &#xD;
  also attend the meeting as an observer, but care should be taken because too &#xD;
  many people in the meeting may cause disruption or cause people to be uncomfortable &#xD;
  in sharing information. Typical daily meetings should have 10 people at most. &#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
During the daily meeting, each team member updates peers with answers to the following &#xD;
three questions &lt;a class=&quot;elementLinkWithUserText&quot; href=&quot;./../../../core.mgmt.common.base/guidances/supportingmaterials/references.mgmt_D80619F3.html#SCH04&quot; guid=&quot;_JlTPUM6aEdyuBO4ZIzcyig&quot;>[SCH04]&lt;/a>: &#xD;
&lt;ol>&#xD;
    &#xD;
  &lt;li> What did I do yesterday?&lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        What will I do today?&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        What is impeding my work?&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ol>&#xD;
&lt;p> These three questions have a specific purpose [&lt;a class=&quot;elementLinkWithUserText&quot; href=&quot;./../../../core.tech.common.base/guidances/supportingmaterials/references.tech_6CCF393.html#SUT06&quot; guid=&quot;_9ToeIB83Edqsvps02rpOOg&quot;>SUT06&lt;/a>]: &#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &#xD;
  &lt;li> The first question tests the focus of the team. Anything done that was &#xD;
    not work planned for the iteration is questioned. &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &#xD;
  &lt;li> Answering the second question revises project strategy daily by reorienting &#xD;
    the team according to dependency changes that were revealed by the response &#xD;
    to the previous question. &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &#xD;
  &lt;li> The third question will create issues that may result in new tasks in the &#xD;
    Work Items list. The most important effect of this question is to create a &#xD;
    list of issues that are assigned to the team or to managers.&amp;nbsp;The team &#xD;
    should expect management to help eliminate bottlenecks.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p> These are the minimum number of questions that satisfy the goals of daily &#xD;
  meetings. Experienced practitioners tend to add an additional question for improving &#xD;
  collaboration among team members: &quot;What have I learned or decided that is of &#xD;
  relevance to the team?&quot; [&lt;a class=&quot;elementLinkWithUserText&quot; href=&quot;./../../../core.tech.common.base/guidances/supportingmaterials/references.tech_6CCF393.html#LAR03&quot; guid=&quot;_9ToeIB83Edqsvps02rpOOg&quot;>LAR03&lt;/a>].&amp;nbsp;&quot;What &#xD;
  might help or hinder others in meeting their commitments?&quot; [&lt;a class=&quot;elementLinkWithUserText&quot; href=&quot;./../../../core.tech.common.base/guidances/supportingmaterials/references.tech_6CCF393.html#YIP&quot; guid=&quot;_9ToeIB83Edqsvps02rpOOg&quot;>YIP&lt;/a>]. &#xD;
  Other topics of discussion (design discussions, chat, and such) should be deferred &#xD;
  until after the meeting. &lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h4>&#xD;
    Value&#xD;
&lt;/h4>&#xD;
&lt;p> For self-directed teams, the daily meeting is a mechanism to quickly inform &#xD;
  the team about the state of the project and people. It supports openness and &#xD;
  enables resolution of dependencies and conflicts in real time. It builds a team; &#xD;
  effective teams are built by regularly communicating, sharing commitments, and &#xD;
  helping each other. [&lt;a class=&quot;elementLinkWithUserText&quot; href=&quot;./../../../core.tech.common.base/guidances/supportingmaterials/references.tech_6CCF393.html#LAR03&quot; guid=&quot;_9ToeIB83Edqsvps02rpOOg&quot;>LAR03&lt;/a>]&lt;/p>&#xD;
  &lt;h3>&#xD;
  What a daily meeting is not &lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The daily meeting is not a status update meeting in which the project manager is collecting information about who is&#xD;
    behind schedule. Rather, it is a meeting in which team members make commitments to each other.&lt;br />&#xD;
    &lt;br />&#xD;
  Neither is it a problem-solving nor issue resolution meeting. Issues that are &#xD;
  raised are registered and usually dealt with by the relevant team members immediately &#xD;
  afterward. It is the project manager's responsibility to resolve them as quickly &#xD;
  as possible or to make sure that someone on the team does. &lt;/p></mainDescription>
