  <mainDescription>&lt;p> This artifact&amp;nbsp;helps you avoid miscommunication by providing two essential &#xD;
  resources: &lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
  &lt;li> A central location to look for terms and abbreviations that are new to &#xD;
    development team members &lt;/li>&#xD;
  &lt;li> Definitions of terms that are used in specific ways within the domain &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p> Definitions for the glossary terms come from several sources, such as requirements &#xD;
  documents, specifications, and discussions with stakeholders and domain experts. &#xD;
&lt;/p></mainDescription>
  <keyConsiderations>&lt;p> Although listed as an &lt;i>output from&lt;/i> and an&lt;i> input to&lt;/i> tasks associated &#xD;
  with the requirements discipline, this artifact can be updated at any time and &#xD;
  by any role as new terms are identified. The terms defined should be used according &#xD;
  to the recorded definitions in all project documentation so that all stakeholders &#xD;
  can clearly see that terms are being used consistently. &lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p> One of the primary decisions when developing&amp;nbsp;this artifact&amp;nbsp;is whether &#xD;
  to have all terms in a single glossary or to maintain terms in several glossaries, &#xD;
  business terms artifacts, or models.&amp;nbsp;If terms are defined in multiple places, &#xD;
  you need to communicate all of those sources to the team and decide which take &#xD;
  precedence. &lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p> It may be important, even in small projects, to reference and use existing &#xD;
  broader glossaries, business terms artifacts, or data models, where they exist. &#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p> Industry- and organization-wide glossaries may be referenced, and compliance &#xD;
  with such specific chosen standards may be required. &lt;/p></keyConsiderations>
  <purpose>&lt;p> These are the purposes of&amp;nbsp;this artifact: &lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
  &lt;li> To record the terms that are being used on the project so that everyone &#xD;
    has a common understanding of them &lt;/li>&#xD;
  &lt;li> To achieve consistency by promoting the use of common terminology across &#xD;
    the project &lt;/li>&#xD;
  &lt;li> To make explicit different stakeholders' use of the same terms to mean &#xD;
    different things or different terms to mean the same thing &lt;/li>&#xD;
  &lt;li> To provide important terms to the Analysis and Design team. &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul></purpose>
  <impactOfNotHaving>Misunderstandings about the meanings of data items account for many failed projects. &#xD;
Increased costs and delayed schedules are associated with projects that lack a &#xD;
common understanding of the terms being used.</impactOfNotHaving>
  <reasonsForNotNeeding>&lt;p> On small projects (for example,&amp;nbsp;enhancement projects), which rely on &#xD;
  a team very familiar with the terms, this artifact may be omitted. &lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p> If a project team has access to the glossary terms in some other form, this&amp;nbsp;artifact &#xD;
  may be disregarded.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>&lt;br /></reasonsForNotNeeding>
  <briefOutline>&lt;p>&#xD;
    A project glossary defines the terms used during all phases of the project. There is a short definition for each term.&#xD;
&lt;/p></briefOutline>
  <representationOptions>&lt;p> This is a simple alphabetical listing of domain terms and their definitions. &#xD;
  It can be captured in a spreadsheet, document, or published on a Wiki site to &#xD;
  simplify access and maintenance. &lt;/p></representationOptions>
